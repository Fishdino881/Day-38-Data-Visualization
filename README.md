# Day-38 Data Visualization


Data visualization is one of the most important skills in data science. It helps transform raw data into clear, meaningful insights that are easy to understand and communicate.

In this module, I focused on visualizing data using Python libraries to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets.
